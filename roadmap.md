## Stuff I am thinking about implementing or refining

- Input validation missing for creating new integration, field syntax validation is already done by HA but perhaps key validation or similar could be peformed?
- Input validation missing for setting integration options, field syntax validation is already done by HA but perhaps key validation or similar could be peformed?
- Perhaps integration with uber/scooters/etc? 
- Implement GTFS Data Flows
