## Automatic installation using HACS

* If you haven't already you must have [HACS installed](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download).
* Go into HACS and search for HASL under the Integrations headline. You will need to restart Home Assistant to finish the process.
* Once that is done reload your GUI (caching issues preventing the integration to be shown).
* Goto Integrations and add HASL integrations.
* Add some nice [GUI/Lovelace](lovelace_cards)
* Enjoy!
